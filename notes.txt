    I could just have this project on live-server, but, I did all this cause I woke up at 5 in the morning messing with  github codespaces
      I did the quickstart tuttorial and they were using npm run dev for the tutorial. I tried to branch buffaloSoldirs on codespaces and 
      could not get the live-server to work. So, this is an attempt to get this on codespaces.
    npm init
    npm install http-server -g
    added os I can run cmd: npm run dev
      package.json > scripts > "dev": "http-server -p 3000"
